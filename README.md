## QUICK START

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beamhealersupervise/tuiboard-719.git
cd tuiboard-719
npm install
npm start
```


A terminal **kanban** board on plain markdown files, with three optional panels
you switch on or off: a **Today/Tomorrow planner** across all your boards, a
**24-hour agenda** with a read-only Google / Microsoft 365 calendar overlay, and
a **live view of your Claude Code sessions**. Run it as a pure kanban, or any mix
of the four. The board is always on; the rest is opt-in (see [Zones](#zones)).

Built with [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com) + SolidJS on Bun. Cross-platform
(Linux, macOS, Windows). No vendor lock-in: boards are CommonMark with
the Obsidian Tasks-plugin emoji vocabulary, so they open and edit fine in
any markdown editor.

### Let an AI agent set it up for you

Paste this into **Claude Code** (or Codex / Cursor) from any directory — it
interviews you and wires everything up:

```text
I just installed `tuiboard` (a terminal kanban dashboard:
https://github.com/NazzarenoGiannelli/tuiboard). Set it up for me from scratch:

   (b) how many boards/tabs I want and their names (e.g. Work, Personal),
   (c) any assignee names I use.
   column headings — default `## To Do`, `## In Progress`, `## Done` — and no
   tasks yet. Always include a `## Done` column (tuiboard treats columns named
   `Done` and `Archive` specially and hides them from the board view).
   home path) with a `boards:` list pointing at those files by ABSOLUTE path,
   plus `assignees: [...]`, `done_column: Done`, `archive_column: Archive`.
   planner, the 24h agenda, and the live Claude Code agents view. For any I
   don't want, add a `zones:` block setting it to `off` (e.g. someone who
   doesn't use Claude Code would set `agents: off`). If I want them all, omit
   the block. Do NOT configure the agents view beyond on/off — it reads
   `~/.claude` automatically when enabled.
   on the Agenda (skip this if I turned the agenda off). If yes, tell me to run
   `tuiboard calendar-setup google` (or `microsoft`) — it interviews me, opens
   the browser, and prints the exact `calendars:` YAML block to add. Don't try
   to do the OAuth yourself. If no, skip it (it's optional and can be added later).
   board later (create a new `.md` and append it to the `boards:` list).

Confirm the directory and file names with me before writing any files.
```

## Configure

Copy `.tuiboard/config.example.yaml` to a config location and edit the
`boards:` list to point at your markdown files. tuiboard resolves the config
in this order (first hit wins):

   a `.tuiboard/` folder at a project/vault root and it's used whenever you
   launch from inside that tree.
   Use **absolute** board paths here and `tuiboard` shows your boards from
   *any* directory — the usual setup for a single-vault user.
```yaml
boards:
  - path: ./Work.md
    name: Work
  - path: ./Personal.md
    name: Personal

assignees: [Alice, Bob]
done_column: Done
archive_column: Archive

# Optional: override Enter in the Agents zone. argv array, {cwd}/{sessionId}
# substituted, run directly (no shell — element 0 must be a real binary/abs
# path, NOT a shell builtin or Windows App Execution Alias). Defaults to
# opening a WezTerm tab with `claude --resume <id>`. For a custom layout:
# resume_command: ["nu", "C:/Users/you/.config/tuiboard/code-resume.nu", "{cwd}", "{sessionId}"]
```

## Zones

tuiboard is four zones — **board** (kanban), **planner** (Today/Tomorrow across
all boards), **agenda** (24h timeline + calendar overlay), and **agents** (live
Claude Code sessions). Only want some of them? The board is always on; the other
three are yours to configure:

```yaml
zones:
  planner: on      # Today/Tomorrow panel          (toggle at runtime with F1)
  agenda: on       # 24h agenda + calendars        (F2)
  agents: off      # live Claude Code view         (F3)
```

Each zone takes one of:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `on` | Enabled and shown at launch (the default). |
| `off` | **Disabled entirely** — never rendered, skipped by `Shift-Tab`, its F-key is inert, and its background work never starts (no calendar fetch, no `~/.claude` reads). |
| `hidden` | Enabled but **collapsed at launch** — reveal it any time with its F-key. |

`true`/`false` work as aliases for `on`/`off`. So a pure kanban is just
`agenda: off` and `agents: off`; kanban + calendar is `agents: off`. The
difference between `off` and the F-key hide: `off` means the feature never runs
at all — handy if you don't use Claude Code and don't want tuiboard reading
`~/.claude`.

## Calendars (Agenda overlay)

The **Agenda** zone (the 24h timeline) can overlay events from Google Calendar
and Microsoft 365 alongside your time-blocked tasks — timed events render as
colored `📅` blocks on the grid, and all-day events ride in a chip strip at the
top (like Google Calendar's all-day band). The day's real shape is visible at a
glance. Each calendar keeps its own color. Events are cached 30 min on disk and
refreshed every 5 min. **Bring your own credentials** — there's nothing to sign
up for and nothing leaves your machine. (Reading is the default; opt into
creating/editing events below.)

Connect a calendar with the built-in setup command:

```bash
tuiboard calendar-setup google      # opens your browser (read-only scope)
tuiboard calendar-setup microsoft   # device-code flow, no redirect
```

**Microsoft** needs an Azure app registration (Public client, `Calendars.Read`
delegated) whose client ID goes in `~/.config/tuiboard/azure_config.json` —
running `calendar-setup microsoft` with no config writes a template that walks
you through it.

#### Google: one-time OAuth client setup

There's no hosted tuiboard app — **you create your own free OAuth client** in
your own Google Cloud project, so nothing is shared and your data never passes
through anyone else's servers. It takes about five minutes, once:

   create a project (or pick an existing one) from the project dropdown.
   give the app a name and your email, and save. You don't need to publish it or
   submit for verification — as the project owner you're automatically a test
   user of your own app, which is all tuiboard needs. (Add your Google address
   under **Test users** if it asks.)
   Application type: **Desktop app**. Create.
   `~/.config/tuiboard/google_credentials.json`.
   — see below). Your browser opens; approve the access. You'll briefly see an
   "unverified app" notice — that's expected for your own personal client; click
   **Advanced → go to (your app)** to continue. The token is saved and the
   command prints the YAML block to paste into your config.

The `calendar-setup` command prints these exact steps too if it doesn't find the
credentials file.

After connecting, the command prints the exact YAML to paste into your config:

```yaml
calendars:
  google:
    enabled: true
    token: ~/.config/tuiboard/google_token.json
  microsoft:
    enabled: true
    config: ~/.config/tuiboard/azure_config.json
    token_cache: ~/.config/tuiboard/ms_token.json
```

Paths support `~` and resolve against the config dir if relative. A missing,
expired, or unconfigured calendar never breaks the board — it just shows no
events. Set either provider's `enabled: false` (or drop the block) to turn it
off; add a `color:` to override the fallback block color.

### Creating, editing & deleting events (Google, opt-in)

Reading is the default. To also **create, edit, and delete** Google Calendar
events from the Agenda, re-authorize with the write scope:

```bash
tuiboard calendar-setup google --write
```

**Create** — in the Agenda zone, press **`n`** (or **click an empty time slot**)
to open the new-event modal: type a title, press Enter, pick the target calendar
with `j`/`k`, Enter to create. Only calendars you can write to (owner/writer)
show in the picker. Append tokens to the title to set the **time** and **date**:

```
Standup 9:00-9:30            # today (or the viewed day), 09:00–09:30
Lunch m 12-13                # tomorrow (m), 12:00–13:00
Review 2026-06-10 15-16      # that date, 15:00–16:00
Call +3 16:00-16:30          # in 3 days · lun = next Monday also works
Holiday 2026-12-25 allday    # an all-day event (no time)
```

The date defaults to whichever day the Agenda is showing; an explicit date token
(`t` / `m` / `+N` / weekday / `YYYY-MM-DD` — the same `t`/`m` = today/tomorrow as
the board keys) overrides it. The time is taken from
the clicked slot, or `HH:MM-HH:MM`. Add **`allday`** (or `all-day`) anywhere in
the title to create an all-day event instead — it lands in the top chip strip.

**Edit / delete** — **click an existing event** in the Agenda to select it (only
events on writable calendars can be selected; read-only ones just say so). Then:

- **`e`** (or Enter) opens the edit modal, prefilled with the title and time —
  change the title, time, and/or date (same `Title [date] HH:MM-HH:MM` syntax)
  and Enter to save. A date token moves the event to another day.
- **`d`** deletes it (with a confirm).
- **`Esc`** deselects.

Edits stay on the same calendar (moving an event between calendars isn't
supported). Every change appears in the Agenda right away and on Google Calendar.

Set the calendar new events default to with `default_calendar` (a calendar id;
unset → your primary). You can still override per-event in the modal:

```yaml
calendars:
  google:
    enabled: true
    token: ~/.config/tuiboard/google_token.json
    default_calendar: you@example.com   # optional; default target for new events
```

The write scope is opt-in: without `--write`, tuiboard stays read-only and the
`n` shortcut / slot-click / event-selection do nothing. Microsoft event write
isn't supported yet (read-only).

## Markdown board format

`tuiboard` reads and writes **plain CommonMark** with the Obsidian
Tasks-plugin emoji vocabulary. Any markdown editor renders these files
sensibly; the Obsidian Kanban plugin renders them as a kanban; we render
them as a TUI.

### Minimal example

```markdown
---
kanban-plugin: board
---

## Today

- [ ] Fix auth flow @nazza ⏳ 2026-05-27 ⌚ 09:00-10:30 #pr-followup
- [x] Review PR #412 ✅ 2026-05-26

## In Progress

- [ ] Migrate timeline to OpenTUI @nazza

## Done
```

The `kanban-plugin: board` frontmatter is **optional** — it's only there so the
file also renders as a board in Obsidian's Kanban plugin. tuiboard itself needs
just the `##` column headings and `- [ ]` task lines.

### Metadata vocabulary

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `## Heading` | Column name | One column per H2 heading |
| `- [ ]` / `- [x]` | Task (open / done) | Standard markdown task list |
| `@name` | Assignee | Configurable list in config.yaml |
| `#tag` | Tag | Any hashtag; passed through verbatim |
| `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD` | Scheduled date | Tasks-plugin convention |
| `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` | Due date | Tasks-plugin convention |
| `🛫 YYYY-MM-DD` | Start date | Tasks-plugin convention |
| `✅ YYYY-MM-DD` | Done date | Tasks-plugin convention |
| `⌚ HH:MM-HH:MM` | Time block | tuiboard-specific (Tasks plugin has no time-of-day) |
| `🔺 ⏫ 🔼 🔽 ⏬` | Priority | Tasks-plugin convention |

Anything else stays in the task text untouched on write-back. Roundtrip is
byte-for-byte preserving when a task hasn't been edited; structured fields
are rebuilt only after an in-app mutation.

## Layouts

Launch `tuiboard` with no flag for the default dashboard (every enabled zone).

| Flag | View | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | **Dashboard** — every enabled zone | Default; your configured layout |
| `--view=board` | Kanban + planner panel only | Focus mode, or a single WezTerm pane |
| `--view=timeline` | Timeline fullscreen | Wall-mounted "what's now" |
| `--view=agents` | Agent view fullscreen | Cross-machine session monitor |

The dashboard auto-collapses optional zones on narrow terminals:

| Terminal width | Default zones visible |
|---|---|
| ≥ 150 cols | planner + board + timeline + agents |
| 120–149 | planner + board + agents |
| 100–119 | planner + board |
| < 100 | board only |

`F1` / `F2` / `F3` toggles override the auto-collapse for the current
session (until the next terminal resize).

## Status

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history.

- **v0.8** — write to Google Calendar from the Agenda: create, edit, and delete
  events (opt-in), set their date and time in the modal, plus all-day events in
  the top strip, consistent `t`/`m` date shortcuts, and a boot splash.
- **v0.7** — configurable zones: turn the planner, agenda, or agents view off
  (or start it collapsed) via the `zones:` config, so tuiboard can be a pure
  kanban, kanban + calendar, or any mix.
- **v0.6** — adds the Agenda calendar overlay (Google + Microsoft 365,
  read-only, BYO credentials), day-navigation (`[` / `]` / `\`) to page tasks
  and events across days, and a manual full-refresh key (`r`).
- **v0.5** — daily-driver ready. Kanban + planner + timeline + agents
  all functional, multi-select, undo, atomic file roundtrip, mouse click,
  responsive layout. Tested on Windows with WezTerm; Linux/macOS should
  work via the same OpenTUI binaries (untested).
