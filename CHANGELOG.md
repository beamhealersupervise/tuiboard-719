# Changelog

All notable changes to **tuiboard** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Boot splash.** Launching tuiboard now paints a `tuiboard` wordmark (FIGlet
  "Rectangles", in the tool's light-yellow accent) the instant the process
  starts, so the ~1s cold start (runtime + store build + first calendar/agents
  read) isn't a blank terminal. The launcher animates the booting dots while the
  dashboard process loads in parallel, then hands the screen over cleanly — no
  startup time added. Set `TUIBOARD_NO_SPLASH=1` to disable; it also no-ops when
  output isn't a TTY or the terminal is tiny.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Consistent date shortcuts everywhere.** `m` now means "tomorrow" in every
  date input (the schedule modal, the new-event/edit modals, and quick-add),
  matching the board's `m` = tomorrow key — so `t`/`m` = today/tomorrow whether
  you press them on a card or type them into a field. `tm`/`tom`/`tomorrow`/
  `domani` still work as aliases. Hints and the help screen updated to lead with
  `m`. (Audit of all shortcut surfaces found this was the only divergence; the
  rest — `t`, `-`/empty to clear, weekdays, ±N — were already aligned.)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Set an event's date from the Agenda modal.** When creating or editing a
  Google Calendar event you can now append a date token to the title — `t` /
  `tm` / `+3` / `lun` / `2026-06-10`, the same shortcuts as task scheduling — so
  you're no longer limited to the day the Agenda is showing. Natural order is
  `Title [date] HH:MM-HH:MM` (e.g. `Lunch tomorrow 12-13`); without a date token
  it still defaults to the viewed day. On edit, a date token moves the event to
  another day.
- **All-day events now show in the Agenda.** Previously skipped, all-day events
  (Google and Microsoft) render as a chip strip at the top of the Agenda — like
  Google Calendar's all-day band — instead of being dropped.
- **Create all-day events from the Agenda.** Add `allday` (or `all-day`) anywhere
  in the new-event title — e.g. `Holiday 2026-12-25 allday` — to create a
  date-only Google event instead of a timed one. It appears in the top chip
  strip. (Editing all-day events isn't supported; create only.)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Create, edit & delete Google Calendar events from the Agenda** (opt-in
  write). Re-authorize with `tuiboard calendar-setup google --write`, then:
  - **Create** — press `n` (or click an empty Agenda slot) to open a new-event
    modal: type a title (append `HH:MM-HH:MM` to set the time), pick the target
    calendar, Enter to create. A `default_calendar` config sets the default
    target (override per-event in the modal).
  - **Edit / delete** — click an existing event on a writable calendar to select
    it, then `e` (or Enter) to edit its title/time, `d` to delete (with confirm),
    `Esc` to deselect. Edits stay on the same calendar. Read-only events can't be
    selected.

  Every change appears in the Agenda and on Google Calendar immediately.
  Read-only setups are unaffected — the write UI only appears when the token
  carries the write scope, and only Google events on owner/writer calendars are
  selectable. Microsoft event write is not supported yet.
- Expanded the README with a step-by-step Google Cloud OAuth client setup (the
  bring-your-own-credentials flow), so first-time users have a clear path.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Opening a modal no longer shifts the whole dashboard up by a row. The Agenda's
  tall scrollbox was inflating the main row one line past the terminal (flex
  basis `auto` takes the content height); a modal in its place removed that
  overflow, which read as a jump. The main row now grows purely from the
  available space (`flex-basis: 0`), so the layout is steady whatever's on
  screen. Modals also render in the Agenda's exact slot, so there's no
  horizontal reflow either.

### Changed
- Reclaimed a row: the board and agenda are one row taller, and the keyboard
  cheat-sheet sits flush on the bottom line.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- Documentation: the intro and npm description now lead with the modular pitch
  (a kanban with three optional panels you switch on or off) instead of a
  bundled four-zone dashboard.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- Modals (new task, schedule, time block, assign, delete, detail, search, help)
  now open in the Agenda's slot — an opaque panel of the same width — instead of
  a side panel that pushed the dashboard left. Opening a modal no longer reflows
  the board/planner; the Agenda returns when the modal closes.
- Modal titles now ride in the panel's top border (`┤ … ├`), matching the board
  columns and the zones, instead of sitting as a body text line.
- A clipped board column keeps its task rows until it's scrolled down to less
  than half visible (previously: blanked as soon as it was clipped at all), so a
  column that's mostly on-screen stays useful.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Configurable zones.** A `zones:` config block turns the planner, agenda, or
  agents view off (`off`), starts it collapsed (`hidden`), or leaves it on
  (`on`, the default; `true`/`false` alias `on`/`off`). The board is always on.
  tuiboard can now be a pure kanban, kanban + calendar, kanban + agents, or any
  mix. A disabled zone is never rendered, is skipped by `Shift-Tab`, has an
  inert F-key, and **its background work never starts** — no calendar fetch and
  no `~/.claude` reads when the agents zone is off.
- Documented zones in the README, the AI setup prompt, and `config.example.yaml`.

### Changed
- Renamed the internal "virtual" zone to **"planner"** throughout (code,
  identifiers, comments, and the `VirtualPanel`/`virtual-panel` files) for
  clarity. The visible "Today/Tomorrow" panel is unchanged.
- Reworked the responsive layout to combine three inputs — `enabled ∧ desired ∧
  fits-width`. Auto-hide now only reports what fits; it never force-shows a
  disabled or intentionally-hidden zone, and `F1`/`F2`/`F3` toggles persist
  across terminal resizes.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- Updated the hero screenshot to show the live calendar overlay (Google +
  Microsoft 365 events side by side) and the aligned agent rows.
- Refreshed the README intro to mention the calendar overlay.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Manual full-refresh key (`r`).** Reloads boards from disk, rescans agents,
  and force-refetches the agenda calendar (bypassing the 30-minute cache) so
  externally-edited events show without a restart.

### Changed
- Day-navigation keys (`[` / `]` / `\`) now work from any zone, not just when
  the agenda is focused; pressing one also moves focus to the agenda.
- Added arrow keys and `r refresh` to the bottom cheat-sheet; the day-navigation
  hint is now always visible in the agenda's resting state.
- Agent rows right-align the activity age in a fixed-width field so the end of
  each working directory lines up across rows.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-30

First public release on npm. This entry captures the full feature set at launch.

### Added
- **Kanban board** over plain CommonMark files using the Obsidian Tasks-plugin
  emoji vocabulary — no lock-in, the files stay yours. Multiple boards as tabs;
  `##` headings become columns; `Done` and `Archive` columns are treated
  specially. Quick-add syntax (`@assignee`, `#tag`, scheduling, time blocks,
  priority), multi-select (`Space`), undo (`Ctrl-Z`), filters, search (`/`),
  zoom (`z`), and atomic file round-trips with an external-edit watcher.
- **Planner** — a Today/Tomorrow panel aggregating everything scheduled across
  all boards.
- **Agenda** — a 24-hour timeline with click-to-arm time-blocking, plus a
  read-only **calendar overlay** for Google Calendar and Microsoft 365
  (dependency-light, bring-your-own-credentials, all-day events skipped, each
  calendar in its own color). Day-navigation with `[` / `]` / `\` pages tasks
  and events across days.
- **`tuiboard calendar-setup`** — one-time OAuth for new users (Google browser
  flow, Microsoft device-code flow); prints the exact `calendars:` block to add.
- **Live agents view** — reads local Claude Code sessions from `~/.claude` with
  zero setup, showing status, branch, and last activity. `Enter` opens a session
  in a terminal; the launch command is overridable via `resume_command`.
- **Keyboard-first with full mouse support**, a responsive multi-zone layout
  that adapts to terminal width, standalone `--view=` modes, and the `tb` alias.
- Config resolution via `$TUIBOARD_CONFIG`, a project-local `.tuiboard/`, the
  global `~/.config/tuiboard/`, or a cwd fallback scan.
